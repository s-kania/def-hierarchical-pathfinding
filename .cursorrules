# Cursor Rules for def-hierarchical-pathfinding

## Server Rules
- NEVER start a Python server for HTML files
- For HTML files, use static file serving or simple file:// protocol
- Do not suggest or run `python -m http.server` or similar Python server commands for HTML content
- Use alternative approaches like Live Server extension or direct file opening

## Git Commit Rules
- ALL commit messages must be written in English
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
- Examples:
  - feat: add new pathfinding algorithm
  - fix: resolve transition point calculation bug
  - docs: update README with installation instructions
  - refactor: improve chunk manager performance
- Never use Polish or other languages in commit messages

## Development Guidelines
- Prefer modern JavaScript ES6+ syntax
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Comment complex algorithms in English
- Follow existing code structure and patterns in the project
